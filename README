# THIS IS A README GUIDE
In this guide we are going to cover how to use git in a terminal, in vsCode and in the github desktop app!!!

## Before starting!!!

make sure you have git installed 

ref: https://git-scm.com/

## TERMINAL

This has to be the worst way to deal with git but I am legally obligated to
talk about it...

### Step one
pick your terminal of choice

for the online guide, I am going to be using powershell but really anything works.

### Step two
configure your username and email

    #### Set up username ####

    ``` git config --global user.name "your_username" ```

    #### Set up email ####

    ``` git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com" ```

    #### check that everything works ####

    ``` git config --global --list ```

### Step three

Grab the HTTPS link for Github

then run (That's the link under)

git clone https://github.com/taz717/LearnGit.git

### Step four

#### useful commands:

>    Grab changes from branch (REMOTE IS origin)

    git pull <REMOTE> <name-of-branch>

>    Create new branch

    git checkout -b <name-of-branch>

>   swap to an existing branch

    git checkout <name-of-branch>

>   get difference between your commit and the next

    git diff

>   get status of branch (what is staged, what isn't)

    git status

>   stage a file

    git add <file-name OR folder-name>

>   commit a file

    git commit -m "COMMENT TO DESCRIBE THE INTENTION OF THE COMMIT"

> push to (probably) github... once again remote is origin

    git push <remote> <name-of-branch>

>   how to clear a branch

    git checkout .
    git reset

## vsCode & github desktop app

## Step one

click on source control on left of vsCode

or 

clone on the top left of the app

## Step two

click clone

## Step three

follow the forms given

It is simple as that, you just need to practice but every command
just has a button to click


# Now this this is out the way

pls go clone, make a branch, add your name to the list in helloWord.py
and make a pr.
